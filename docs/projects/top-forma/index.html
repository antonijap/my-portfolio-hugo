<h3 id="project-intro">PROJECT INTRO</h3>

<p>I was hired to improve user experience and design user interface. This app is intended for clients that interact with nutritionists in TopForma. Every client gets a specialized diet based on a survey they fill prior to usage. The process is repeated every month. App provides recipes for each day, basic analytics, communication with nutritionists and customer support and shopping list.</p>

<p>It was an exciting and challenging task as every section of the app is vastly different from another, yet interface and flow needed to be simple, logical and easy to use.</p>

<h3 id="process">PROCESS</h3>

<p>A client knew the target audience in depth so he was leading me through interface and functionalities. They already had wireframes in place, my job was to create a design that conforms to complex functionalities they offer and to stay user-friendly for every level of computer competence.</p>

<p>The first phase was to develop mobile apps. I provided developers with both iOS and Android designs. I used Sketch as a screen design tool and handoff was made in Zeplin.</p>

<h3 id="outcome">OUTCOME</h3>

<p>We did testing with some nutritionists and after a couple of months we were happy with the interface and intended user experience. I also assisted the developer in the development phase by exporting assets and providing solutions for various states and errors.</p>
