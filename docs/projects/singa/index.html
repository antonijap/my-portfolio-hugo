<h3 id="project-intro">PROJECT INTRO</h3>

<p>I was hired as a full-time product designer. I am responsible for UI/UX of all apps (BTB and BTC) on various platforms. I also assist sales and marketing teams with graphical assets and videography.
When I first came to Singa I had to detect friction points and downsides of products and I did that using analytical tools that were at my disposal. Once I detected what was keeping sales from going up, I revamped information architecture and provided refreshed designs while at it. After all changes went live, growth trend started to have a steeper line upwards. During the redesign, I created a design system and brand guidelines to consolidate resources and provide a single source of truth for all team members.</p>

<h3 id="solving-problem">SOLVING PROBLEM</h3>

<p>I had to revamp iOS, Android and web app. I started with the web since Google Analytics contained the most information about users. I immediately detected that most audience wants to search the song, and search functionality was buried in the interface three clicks away. A personal profile was very confusing because different buttons opened the same views. It was very hard to upgrade to a paid subscription. There was no clear path to do that, and downgrading was hard to find and generated a lot of customer support tickets. The overall design seemed outdated and inconsistent. This was a top-level audit, there were more issues that I resolved along the way like consistent typography and spacing.</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<ul>
<li>Too complex information architecture and navigation</li>
<li>No clear upselling</li>
<li>Complex navigation system</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="process-for-web">PROCESS FOR WEB</h3>

<p>The most important thing was to de-clutter navigation and offer search on landing page since the majority of people just want to search for a song they want to sing.
I realized a registration form has one input that is not utilized anywhere, so after a talk with developers, we decided to hide the username field and generate it in the backend. Now registration success is around 96%.
Profile section is now completely redesigned and has much more functionality. From recently, we have a proper off-boarding flow to reduce churn and help users resolve potential issues that might lead to cancellation of service.
Other improvements include a new modern typeface, usage of a grid system, a new payment form etc.</p>

<h3 id="process-for-ios-and-andriod">PROCESS FOR IOS AND ANDRIOD</h3>

<p>As in the web, navigation was very hard to use and it needed to be redesigned in order to elevate user experience to a next level. It used to be a hamburger navigation with a whole search functionality crammed into a side-panel that took less than 50% of screen estate when active. I switched to a tab bar navigation and made search prominent as a separate tab bar item. Since search is crucial to Singa, I updated the design of the search results to reflect the newest trends and best practices.</p>

<h3 id="outcome">OUTCOME</h3>

<p>After a few months of hard work, numbers started to grow on all platforms. iOS had the biggest growth. The app even got picked up by Apple in their collections that drove even more users.</p>

<h3 id="additional-projects">ADDITIONAL PROJECTS</h3>

<p>Along with mobile and web apps, there is a professional iPad app for BTB clients, Apple TV, and Android TV apps and a small web app for sending song requests to KJs from within venues with Singa PRO system installed.</p>
