### PROJECT INTRO
Desk Rebellion was a short-term project for a client. It is a workout app for people working. It supposed to remind you to stretch and do a little workout in order to avoid back pain. I was hired by an iOS developer to conduct a research and design an app.

### PROCESS
PayTrack is an iOS app for managing and tracking flight attendants monthly salary. I am collaborating on the project as an UI/UX designer. There are plenty of parameters that have to be taken into account when calculating salary, so the main goal of this app is to simplify that process and be super easy to use. The app will soon be released to the App Store. The new version of the app is planned for the next major update and will feature dark interface.
