### PROJECT INTRO
I was hired as a full-time product designer. I am responsible for UI/UX of all apps (BTB and BTC) on various platforms. I also assist sales and marketing teams with graphical assets and videography.

When I first came to Singa I had to detect friction points and downsides of products and I did that using analytical tools that were at my disposal. Once I detected what was keeping sales from going up, I revamped information architecture and provided refreshed designs while at it. After all changes went live, growth trend started to have a steeper line upwards. During the redesign, I created a design system and brand guidelines to consolidate resources and provide a single source of truth for all team members.
