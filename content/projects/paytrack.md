### PROJECT INTRO
This was one of my early projects, I was hired by a friend who works as a flight attendant and develops apps in free time. He was struggling with tracking hours and all sorts of parameters that determine final salary. He was not the only one, many struggled and were sometimes paid less because they never knew the final number. He decided to make a tool which only needs a light input from flight attendants and then it calculates salary in the background.

### SOLVING PROBLEM
Flight attendants don't have a fixed salary, it is based on working hours and a plethora of other parameters. It is very hard to track it and sometimes it happens that they are paid less than the actual hours they worked. The solution was to provide a simple input for every flight and do the math for the user.

### PROCESS
As my friend was a target audience I gathered the majority of information from him, but we asked others for feedback as well. I decided to display a calendar on the main view, and then use colors to mark the working days. The user flow starts by tapping on the desired date and filing the necessary information about the flight. The main view always contains the information that is useful for flight attendants.
