### PROJECT INTRO
I was hired to improve user experience and design user interface. This app is intended for clients that interact with nutritionists in TopForma. Every client gets a specialized diet based on a survey they fill prior to usage. The process is repeated every month. App provides recipes for each day, basic analytics, communication with nutritionists and customer support and shopping list.


It was an exciting and challenging task as every section of the app is vastly different from another, yet interface and flow needed to be simple, logical and easy to use.

### PROCESS
A client knew the target audience in depth so he was leading me through interface and functionalities. They already had wireframes in place, my job was to create a design that conforms to complex functionalities they offer and to stay user-friendly for every level of computer competence.


The first phase was to develop mobile apps. I provided developers with both iOS and Android designs. I used Sketch as a screen design tool and handoff was made in Zeplin.

### OUTCOME
We did testing with some nutritionists and after a couple of months we were happy with the interface and intended user experience. I also assisted the developer in the development phase by exporting assets and providing solutions for various states and errors.
