<h3 id="project-intro">PROJECT INTRO</h3>

<p>I have been working on my Swift skills for a couple of years and I decided to make more complex app. This time I didn&rsquo;t use storyboards, the user interface was done through code with Snapkit. The backbone of Lez is Firestore and Pusher handles push notifications. The first version is just released, next step is acquiring users. I will write more about that in next few months.</p>

<h3 id="process">PROCESS</h3>

<p>It all started with my own frustration, I couldn&rsquo;t find other lesbians for hanging out. For some time I thought this was only my problem but as it turned out many other lesbians on the interned claimed they have the same problem. That intrigued me and I decided to find out more. I conducted a series of surveys to capture a status of a lesbian community today. I have found out that they are an underserved market with needs definitely not being addressed. A simple query like &ldquo;lesbian app&rdquo; renders tons of dating apps but that is not what lesbians want, it seems.</p>

<p><img class="image-spacer-solo" src="/images/lez_survey.jpg"></p>

<p>I started with my prototype to see if I can validate my ideas. I made a design in Figma and then proceeded to Xcode. In a few months, I had a working app with basic functionalities. Numbers definitely showed interest and a need exists.
‍</p>

<p>Now, I am learning React Native to expand Lez to a new level and to offer it for Android as well. In the meantime, I am looking for teammates and potential investors. If you see yourself in this project, please, don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me.</p>
